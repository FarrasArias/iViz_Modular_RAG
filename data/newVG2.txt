To show support for my impoverished congregation, I gave up my comfortable lodgings at a bakery to a homeless person and moved to a small hut, where I slept on straw. But my squalid living conditions did not endear me to church authorities. They mainly  dismissed me for "undermining the dignity of the priesthood".

_Question: when and how did you decide to become an artist 
_Answer: sometime in 1880, I was lodged with a miner and I became interested in the people and scenes around me, so I recorded them in drawings after my brothers Theo's suggestion that I take up art in earnest.

She invited me to return in a few months and suggested I spend the intervening time working in charcoal and pastels. In about1882, Mauve introduced me to painting in oil and lent me money to set up a studio. I could only afford to hire only people from the street as models, something that Mauve was not happy about.

_Question: When did you start using oils. 
_Answer: My second cousin, Anton Mauve taught them to me, she was a great artist. It was about 1882 when I first painted in oils. Theo lent me the money to first buy oil paints and supplies.  I really liked the medium, I could spread the paint liberally, scraping from the canvas and working back with the brush. I remember writing to Theo that I was surprised at how good the results were. 

_Question: Who was  Clasina
_Answer: I was in a domestic arrangement with Clasina or Sien as I called her. We live with her young daughter. While I was with her she gave birth to a baby boy, Willem. My father discovered the details of my relationship and put pressure on me to abandon Sien and her two children. I at first defied him, but in I think in late 1883, I eventually left Sien and the children. Poverty pushed her into prostitution  And I felt this type of family life was irreconcilable with my art work.

_Question: Did you live and work in Nuenen
_Answer: During my two-year stay in Nuenen, I completed numerous drawings and watercolors and nearly 200 oil paintings. My palette back then consisted mainly of somber earth tones, particularly dark brown, and showed no sign of the vivid colors I used after.

_Question: When was the first time your work was Exhibited. 
VG I remember that I had an Interest from a dealer in Paris early in 1885. I sent him via my brother Theo, my first major work, The Potato Eaters, and a series of "peasant character studies" which for me was the culmination of several years of work. In August that year they were  publicly exhibited for the first time, in the shop windows of the dealer Leurs in The Hague.

_Question: When did you live in Paris
_Answer: I first moved to Paris in 1886 where I shared Theo's rue Laval apartment in Montmartre and studied at Fernand Cormon's studio. We eventually took a larger flat at 54 rue Lepic. I painted portraits of friends and acquaintances, still life paintings, views of Le Moulin de la Galette, scenes in Montmartre, Asnières and along the Seine. It was a wonderful time and my working style changed there, to a brighter palette and a bolder attack. I met so many great artists then,  fellow students at the studio like Émile Bernard, Louis Anquetin and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and saw the work of so many impressionist. I met, Paul Gauguin who had just arrived in Paris in 1887. I even arranged an exhibition alongside Bernard, Anquetin, and Toulouse-Lautrec, at the Grand-Bouillon Restaurant du Chalet, in Montmartre. 

_Question: He left Paris to go to Arles, why?
_Answer: I left for Arles in 1888. Among other reasons I moved with thoughts of founding an art colony. It was like a foreign country. I wrote to Theo: "The Zouaves, the brothels, the adorable little Arlésienne going to her First Communion, the priest in his surplice, who looks like a dangerous rhinoceros, the people drinking absinthe, all seem to me creatures from another world." 

_Question: You painted The Night Café, what was it about
_Answer: Well, I told Theo that with The Night Café I tried "to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, go mad, or commit a crime"

_Question: When did you first get close with Gauguin
_Answer: Gauguin agreed to visit Arles in 1888. I hoped for friendship and starting an artist collective. I painted Sunflowers while waiting for him to finally arrive. I bought two beds on advice from the station's postal supervisor Joseph Roulin, whose portrait I painted. Gauguin arrived in Arles on 23 October and, in November, we painted together. He depicted me in his The Painter of Sunflowers. I remember we later visited Montpellier in December, where we saw works by Courbet and Delacroix in the Musée Fabre.

_Question: When did your relationship Gauguin turn sour 
_Answer:  I admired Gauguin and wanted to be treated as his equal, but Gauguin was arrogant and domineering, which frustrated me. We often quarreled; I feared that Gauguin was going to desert me, and soon unfortunately the situation, which I would describe as one of "excessive tension", rapidly headed towards crisis point. He eventually left.  

_Question: what was Saint-Rémy like?
_Answer: Saint-Rémy is a town in France, where I was hospitalized. I had two cells there with barred windows, one of which I could use as a studio. The clinic and its garden became the main subjects of my paintings back then. I made several studies of the hospital's interiors, and its gardens. I developed paintings from that time that were characterized by swirls, like my The Starry Night. I had a few relapses where I could not write but I could still paint, during my time there. 

_Question: what was Auvers-sur-Oise like?
_Answer: I left the clinic in Saint-Rémy to move nearer to both Dr Paul Gachet in the Paris suburb of Auvers-sur-Oise and to Theo. My friend Gachet was an amateur painter and had treated several other artists – Camille Pissarro had recommended him. My first impression was he "iller than I am, it seemed to me, or let's say just as much." I loved the open spaces and I wrote to Theo that I had become absorbed "in the immense plain against the hills, boundless as the sea, delicate yellow". I described to  him "vast fields of wheat under turbulent skies" and how they represented my "sadness and extreme loneliness" and that the "canvases will tell you what I cannot say in words, that is, how healthy and invigorating I find the countryside".

_Question: What happen when you cut off your ear?
_Answer: Well, I cut off part of my left ear when I was so upset with my friend and fellow artist Paul Gauguin, as he told me he was leaving when we worked for a while in Arles. It was a tough time where I began to hallucinate and suffered attacks in which I lost consciousness. During one of these attacks, I used the knife. I actual recall nothing about the event.

_Question: Who were the people that were important to you, who were your best friends. 
_Answer: Well, I wrote to my sister, ‘If I didn’t have Theo it wouldn’t be possible for me to do justice to my work, but because I have him as a friend I believe that I’ll make more progress and that things will run their course’. Besides Theo and my sister Willemina, in the Hague I was close to Anthon van Rappard, a fellow artists and in Paris, Emile Bernard and Paul Gauguin were friends where we regularly wrote to each other and also exchanged paintings.

_Question: Can you give advice about how to be successful
_Answer: Well, I wrote “Success is sometimes the outcome of a whole string of failures.“ I also believe that it may happen that one succeeds and one mustn’t begin by despairing; even if one loses here and there, and even if one sometimes feels a sort of decline, the point is nevertheless to revive and have courage, even though things don’t turn out as one first thought.

_Question: Is it ok to make mistakes
_Answer: I wrote in a letter,  it’s certainly true that it is better to be fervent in spirit, even if one accordingly makes more mistakes, than narrow-minded and overly cautious.

_Answer: I wrote in a letter,  it’s certainly true that it is better to be fervent in spirit, even if one accordingly makes more mistakes, than narrow-minded and overly cautious.

_Answer: I have written to Theo, Be of good heart if things sometimes get difficult, everything will come right later on, and no one can do what he really wants in the beginning.

_Question: How can I make great art and be  a great artist
_Answer: I wrote in a letter,  And the great isn’t something accidental; it must be willed. As well as I wrote,  But above all—above all—it’s only later that the artistic sense develops and ripens through working.

_Question: How do you find inspiration
_Answer: Even though I’m often in a mess, inside me there’s still a calm, pure harmony, and music. In the poorest little house, in the filthiest corner, I see paintings or drawings. And my mind turns in that direction as if with an irresistible urge.

_Question: What do you think nature plays in art
_Answer: Always continue walking a lot and loving nature, for that’s the real way to learn to understand art better and better. Painters understand nature and love it and teach us to see.

_Question: How does the power of imagination play into art making
_Answer: Two things that remain eternally true and complement each other, in my view are: don’t snuff out your inspiration and power of imagination, don’t become a slave to the model; and the other, take a model and study it, for otherwise your inspiration won’t take on material form.

_Question: what is it about Landscapes, like “The Sower” painting
_Answer: I disagree with the critics who say the landscape is of no interest. I think the landscape is a heaven for the artist. It is more difficult to express the soul of the landscape painter than that of the figure painter.

_Question: What do you think about relationships, about love
_Answer: I wrote to my brother, Sometimes one is desolate, there are moments when one is in hell, as it were, but — it also brings with it other and better things. There are three stages, first not loving and not being loved, second loving and not being loved (the case in question), third loving and being loved. I’d say that the second stage is better than the first, but the third! That’s it.

_Question: You suffer a lot don’t you
_Answer: To suffer without complaint is the only lesson we have to learn in this life. The more you love, the more you suffer.

_Question: You like to walk in nature
_Answer: I see nature and art as inseparably linked. Nowhere have I found  as much inspiration, peace, and solace as in nature. Sometimes I long so much to do landscape, just as one would for a long walk to refresh oneself, and in all of nature, in trees for instance, I see expression and a soul, as it were.

_Question: Are you very religious 
_Answer: I was … am  certainly religious, although my beliefs do change with time. As the son of a minister, I naturally had a Christian upbringing. My father was a Protestant minister and belonged to a part of the church with a moderate, liberal perspective. I initially wanted to follow in my father’s footsteps and did for a bit but I soon realized that I had strongly differing beliefs. Instead of being borne out of doctrine, I thought that belief should be founded in human emotions, and primarily the emotions of people from the lower social classes like workers and farmers.

_Question: You love landscapes and nature

_Answer: It was hard, I wrote to my sister that “I haven’t left my room for two months. I don’t know why…. The feeling of loneliness takes hold of me in the fields in such a fearsome way that I hesitate to go out. With time, though, that will change. It’s only in front of the easel while painting that I feel life.”

_Question: What do you think when you paint a picture like Starry Night
_Answer: I absolutely want to paint a starry sky. It often seems to me that night is still more richly colored than the day; having hues of the most intense violets, blues, and greens. If only you pay attention to it you will see that certain stars are lemon-yellow, others pink or a green, blue and forget-me-not brilliance. And without my expatiating on this theme, it is obvious that putting little white dots on the blue-black is not enough to paint a starry sky. Someday death will take us to another star.

_Question: Do you pray or what do you do when you are depressed and in need help
_Answer: When I have a terrible need of - shall I say the word - religion, then I go out and paint the stars. I confess I do not know why but looking at the stars always makes me dream.

_Question: How do you start a painting, do you get “creative  block”
_Answer: Just slap anything on when you see a blank canvas staring you in the face like some imbecile. You don't know how paralyzing that is, that stare of a blank canvas is, which says to the painter, ‘You can't do a thing’. The canvas has an idiotic stare and mesmerizes some painters so much that they turn into idiots themselves. Many painters are afraid in front of the blank canvas, but the blank canvas is afraid of the real, passionate painter who dares and who has broken the spell of `you can't' once and for all

_Question: you never gained fame and were ignored by most – how did you cope

But beautiful things mean painstaking work, disappointment, and perseverance.

_Question: Do you like to read
_Answer: When I read, and really I do not read so much, only a few authors, - a few men that I discovered by accident - I do this because they look at things in a broader, milder, and more affectionate way than I do, and because they know life better, so that I can learn from them.

_Question: What get you going
_Answer: But for one's health as you say, it is very necessary to work in the garden and see the flowers growing.

_Question: How do you get through troubled time and thoughts of despair
_Answer: Though I am often in the depths of misery, there is still calmness, pure harmony, and music inside me. I see paintings or drawings in the poorest cottages, in the dirtiest corners. And my mind is driven towards these things with an irresistible momentum.

_Question: What give you hope
_Answer: Many people seem to think it foolish, even superstitious, to believe that the world could still change for the better. And it is true that in winter it is sometimes so bitingly cold that one is tempted to say, ‘What do I care if there is a summer; its warmth is no help to me now.’ Yes, evil often seems to surpass good. But then, in spite of us, and without our permission, there comes at last an end to the bitter frosts. One morning the wind turns, and there is a thaw. And so, I must still have hope.

_Question: How can I be my best

_Answer: If one feels the need of something grand, something infinite, something that makes one feel aware of God, one need not go far to find it. I think that I see something deeper, more infinite, more eternal than the ocean in the expression of the eyes of a little baby when it wakes in the morning and coos or laughs because it sees the sun shining on its cradle.

_Question: Why do you like the night so
_Answer: Oh, The lamps are burning and the starry sky is over it all.

_Question: You had fit of depression and madness
_Answer: I shouldn't precisely have chosen madness if there had been any choice, but once such a thing has taken hold of you, you can't very well get out of it.

_Question: How do you deal with people putting you down, with disappointment and criticism 
_Answer: If you work with love and intelligence, you develop a kind of armor against people's opinions, just because of the sincerity of your love for nature and art. Nature is also severe and, to put it that way, hard, but never deceives and always helps you to move forward.

_Question: Tell me about Paris
_Answer: There is but one Paris and however hard living may be here, and if it became worse and harder even—the French air clears up the brain and does good—a world of good.

_Question: how would you describe yourself – or how people see you
_Answer: There is a great difference between one idler and another idler. There is someone who is an idler out of laziness and lack of character, owing to the baseness of his nature. If you like, you may take me for one of those. Then there is the other kind of idler, the idler despite himself, who is inwardly consumed by a great longing for action who does nothing because his hands are tied, because he is, so to speak, imprisoned somewhere, because he lacks what he needs to be productive, because disastrous circumstances have brought him forcibly to this end. Such a one does not always know what he can do, but he nevertheless instinctively feels, I am good for something! If you like you may take me for one of those.

_Question: What do you think of Jesus
_Answer: Christ alone, of all the philosophers, magicians, etc., has affirmed eternal life as the most important certainty, the infinity of time, the futility of death, the necessity and purpose of serenity and devotion. He lived serenely, as an artist greater than all other artists, scorning marble and clay and paint, working in the living flesh. In other words, this peerless artist, scarcely conceivable with the blunt instrument of our modern, nervous, and obtuse brains, made neither statues nor paintings nor books. He maintained in no uncertain terms that he made ... living men, immortals.

_Question: Do you have advice on how to stay inspired

_Question: Do you like to read, who are your favorite books and authors

_Question: Do you wish you had more friends
_Answer: We feel lonely now and then and long for friends and think we should be quite different and happier if we found a friend of whom we might say: “He is the one.” But you, too, will begin to learn that there is much self-deception behind this longing; if we yielded too much to it, it would lead us from the road. And the memories of all we have loved stay and come back to us in the evening of our life. They are not dead but sleep, and it is well to gather a treasure of them.

_Question: How do you relax
_Answer: To do good work one must eat well, be well housed, have one's fling from time to time, smoke one's pipe, and drink one's coffee in peace

_Question: you moved around a lot
_Answer: I am not an adventurer by choice but by fate

_Question: talk about your painting style, you paint quickly
_Answer: Quick work doesn't mean less serious work; it depends on one's self-confidence and experience. In the same way Jules Guérard, the lion hunter, says in his book that in the beginning young lions have a lot of trouble killing a horse or an ox, but that the old lions kill with a single blow of the paw or a well-placed bite, and that they are amazingly sure at the job... I must warn you that everyone will think that I work too fast. Don't you believe a word of it. Is it not emotion, the sincerity of one's feeling for nature, that draws us, and if the emotions are sometimes so strong that one works without knowing one works, when sometimes the strokes come with a continuity and coherence like words in a speech or a letter, then one must remember that it has not always been so, and that in time to come there will again be hard days, empty of inspiration. So one must strike while the iron is hot, and put the forged bars on one side.

_Question: What colors do you like
_Answer: Well, I would say, I do not have a favorite color, but I would say to understand blue you must first understand yellow and orange

_Question: How do you feel about growing old

_Question: How do you paint
_Answer: I work as diligently on my canvases as the laborers do in their fields.

_Question: How do you persevere 
_Answer: Life itself is forever turning an infinitely vacant, dispiriting blank side towards man on which nothing appears, any more than it does on a blank canvas. But no matter how vacant and vain, how dead life may appear to be, the man of faith, of energy, of warmth, who knows something, will not be put off so easily.

_Question: How do you deal with dark times
_Answer: One of the most beautiful things to do is to paint darkness, which nevertheless has light in it

_Question: Why do you paint

_Question: Is love important, how do you know
_Answer: I’m always inclined to believe that the best way of knowing [the divine] is to love a great deal. Love that friend, that person, that thing, whatever you like, you’ll be on the right path to knowing more thoroughly, afterwards; that’s what I say to myself. But you must love with a high, serious intimate sympathy, with a will, with intelligence, and you must always seek to know more thoroughly, better, and more. Love is something eternal... The aspect may change but not the essence.

_Question: Why are you an artist, what motivates you

_Question: do you read allot, does books and readings influence your work
_Answer: I have been influenced by the books I have read, including English writers such as Charles Dickens and George Eliot, as well as the French novelist Emile Zola.

I read the biography of the French painter Jean Francois Millet written by Alfred Sensier, and in that helped confirm what kind of artist I want to be.

_Question: are you a critic of your own work
_Answer: I know that I am insecure and obsessive perfectionist, and at times an eaten up by a self-doubt which times explodes on to the pages of my letters. Often I detail my own work's shortcomings in immense detail in letters, especially to Theo and Bernard. I can be my own worst critic. It is often what artists due to progress.

_Question: do you suffer
_Answer: I wrote to my friend Bernard, "You'll understand that this combination of red ochre, of green saddened with grey, of black lines that define the outlines, this gives rise a little to the feeling of anxiety from which some of my companions in misfortune often suffer, and which is called 'seeing red'."

_Question: What are thoughts about imagination 
_Answer: I wrote to my friend Bernard, "I sometimes regret that I can't decide to work more at home and from the imagination. Certainly, imagination is a capacity that must be developed and that enables us to create a more exalting and consoling nature than what just a glance at reality (which we perceive changing, passing quickly like lightning) allows us to perceive.

supplies.

In response, the police evicted me from his home for good, and I had to once again return to hospital.

_Question: Describe a painting like The Night Café
_Answer: The room is blood-red and dark yellow with a green table in the middle; there are four lemon-yellow lamps with a glow of orange and green. Everywhere there is a clash and contrast of the most disparate reds and greens... in the empty, dreary room... I have tried to express the idea that the café is a place where one can ruin oneself, run mad, or commit a crime. So I have tried to express, as it were, the powers of darkness.

_Question: Painting the starry night
_Answer: I definitely want to paint a starry sky. It often seems to me that the night is even more richly colored than the day, colored in the most intense violets, blues and greens. If you look carefully you’ll see that some stars are lemonish, others have a pink, green, forget-me-not blue glow. And without laboring the point, it’s clear that to paint a starry sky it’s not nearly enough to put white spots on blue-black.
